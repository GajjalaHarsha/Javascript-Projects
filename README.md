1.ToDo List\
It is a simple todo app built using DOM manipulation\
\
2.A sample project using Event Listener and setInterval\
It has following requiremenrts\
a. It take 2 inputs 'name' and 'Delay In Seconds'\
b. whenever we modify 'Name' it should display below input saying 'Hi ---- 'whatever input given in name get updated in ----\
c. Suppose if you dont modify input for 'Delay In seconds' by default 20 sec/ whatever input is given in it.\
          c1.Pop up should get displayed, saying "do you want modify name", If you press\
			'ok'     ->you can continue to modify\
  			'cancel' -> you cant modify 'Name i/p' for next 20sec/'Delay In seconds'. Even If you try, it should not get updated.\
d.Now when you click 'cancel', timer should get displayed below that ' you have to wait for ---- sec from now' as -- should get updated \every sec
e. when timer get to '0', it should get display as "modify now".\
f.check by giving input in 'Delay in seconds' and check\
g.When there is no text input name then you cant give a popup 'do ypu want to modify name; even if it is inactive more than 'Delay In Seconds'\
