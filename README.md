1.ToDo List\

It is a simple todo app built using DOM manipulation	<br/>

2.A sample project using Event Listener and setInterval<br/>

It has following requirements<br/>

a. It take 2 inputs 'name' and 'Delay In Seconds'<br/>

b. whenever we modify 'Name' it should display below input saying 'Hi ---- 'whatever input given in name get updated in ----<br/>

c. Suppose if you dont modify input for 'Delay In seconds' by default 20 sec/ whatever input is given in it. <br/>

          c1.Pop up should get displayed, saying "do you want modify name", If you press <br/>

			'ok'     ->you can continue to modify <br/>

  			'cancel' -> you cant modify 'Name i/p' for next 20sec/'Delay In seconds'. Even If you try, it should not get updated. <br/>

d.Now when you click 'cancel', timer should get displayed below that ' you have to wait for ---- sec from now' as -- should get updated every sec <br/>

e. when timer get to '0', it should get display as "modify now".<br/>

f.check by giving input in 'Delay in seconds' and check <br/>
